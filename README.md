# OC-Team1
A repository for Team 1's online community system. The theme used is `glass` and the color scheme is as stated in the [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A0F9mmAqOf0RzJghsJPvNyH0efNUKASVpZXscHCBxy4/edit).

## How to edit?
Open up your HTML file and scroll down until you see this comment `<!-- enter your code here -->`. The comment is in maybe the last `div` element which representing the whitespace below the dashboard. If you want to edit some CSS codes, please be mindful so that the navigation and the dashboard are not messed up. It is recommended to create a new class instead for your page(s). If you're not sure of anything, just contact me.

## DISCLAIMER!
Each of the HTML files have the same structure but not necessarily means they have the exactly the same code. So, please becareful.
